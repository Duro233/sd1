   <h2>Project Description</h2>
   <p>The Smart Breaker is an innovative redesign of the conventional household breaker, combining safety, reliability, and modern connectivity. Unlike traditional mechanical breakers that are prone to wear and failure, the Smart Breaker uses a MCU to provide faster and more dependable protection against overcurrent, short circuits, arc faults, and ground faults. Equipped with real-time monitoring, temperature sensing, and wireless communication, it allows users to track energy usage, receive alerts, and remotely trip the breaker through a smartphone app or website. Compact enough to fit into a standard breaker box, the Smart Breaker enhances electrical safety while supporting predictive maintenance, smart home integration, and future scalability for both residential and commercial applications.</p>
